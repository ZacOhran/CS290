I like the layout of the website and how easy it is to find information. Key information, like my Headhshot percentage, is displayed in an area that is easily seen. The buttons are also labeled and organized perfectly to find all the information I would want.

I like the banner that covers the screen as I enter the website, though finding other information and links isn't the easiest. Color scheme is interesting and a classic profile dropdown menu lets me navigate my account with ease.

It's okay. Cool interface that leads to other pages with good information. Profile has a pernament drop down menu with infomrmation ready that I really like.

Wikepedia has one of the most familiar layouts which makes it the best. I already know where the information is going to be, the order information is going to be presented, and where to look for images and sources. 10/10
