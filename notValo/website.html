                    <h2>About Valorant</h2>
                    <p class="textOverflow">VALORANT is an online FPS shooter video game developed by Riot. The premise
                        of the game is to
                        either set off a bomb or stop the bomb from exploding. Two teams of five compete together on
                        one map with two to three 'sites' where the bomb can be 'planted.' One team is defending these
                        sites, the other attacking. Each team has the same character options, though someperform better
                        on either attacking or defending sides. Each game is played until one team has thirteen wins,
                        which can take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour. Before each round is a buy phase where
                        players can purchase guns, shields/armor, and abilities. The amount of money a player has is
                        determined by thier previous round's money and rewards for how well they did last round. Doing
                        well for multiple rounds in a row results in a lot more money given, though there is a money
                        reward for losing streaks to help teams get out of ruts.<br>
                        The game was first announced under the codename Project A in October 2019, and was officially
                        released on June 2, 2020.</p>
