        <dd class="agentDesc">- Duelists are expected to entry, meaning they are the first
            ones to enter the sight. <br> Most have some sort of ability to
            get away from the inevitable bullets fired at them. <br>Some
            have movement abilities, while others have flashes or
            nearisght to limit the <br>vision of the enemies. </dd>

        </dt>
        <dd class="agentDesc">- Controllers main goal is to break line of sight from the
            enemy team to theirs. Their<br> abilities consist of what are
            called 'smokes,' coming from smoke grenades common<br> in video
            games. Many have one use of their abilities, so Controllers
            must have the <br>game sense and timing down to be effective.</dd>

            <h5 class="agentType">Sentinals</h3>
        </dt>
        <dd class="agentDesc">- Sentinals are players who watch behind the party, usually
            through an ability that <br>hidners the enemy team from coming
            from behind, or at least slow them down.</dd>

        <dd class="agentDesc">- Initiators are in charge of helping the duelist get the team
            onto the sight. They <br>usually have abilities similar to flash
            grenades that can give the team some room to<br> move around while
            the enemies can't see. Others have abilities to reveal the
            location <br>of enemies as they hide behind cover, sometimes
            highlighting them from behind cover.</dd>
