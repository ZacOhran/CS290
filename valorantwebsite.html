        <p id="firstIntro">
            VALORANT is an online FPS shooter video game developed by Riot. The premise
            of the game is to
            either set off a bomb or stop the bomb from exploding. Two teams of five compete together on
            one map with two to three 'sites' where the bomb can be 'planted.' One team is defending
            these sites, the other attacking. Each team has the same character options, though some
            perform better on either attacking or defending sides. Each game is played until one team
            has thirteen wins, which can take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour. Before each round
            is a buy phase where players can purchase guns, shields/armor, and abilities. The amount of
            money a player has is determined by thier previous round's money and rewards for how well
            they did last round. Doing well for multiple rounds in a row results in a lot more money given,
            though there is a money reward for losing streaks to help teams get out of ruts.
